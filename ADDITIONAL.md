## Mental Frameworks for Mycelium Usage

### 1. INVEST — Task Quality Gate

Before creating or updating any task, validate it against these criteria.
A task that fails more than one is not ready to be written.

| Criterion | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Independent** | Can be completed without unblocking other tasks first |
| **Negotiable** | The *what* is fixed; the *how* remains open |
| **Valuable** | Produces a verifiable, concrete outcome |
| **Estimable** | If you cannot size it, it is too vague or too large |
| **Small** | If it spans more than one work cycle, split it |
| **Testable** | Has an explicit, binary done condition |

> If a task fails **Estimable** or **Testable**, convert it to an Epic and decompose.

### 2. DAG — Dependency Graph Thinking

Before scheduling or prioritizing, model the implicit dependency graph.

**Rules:**
- No task moves to `in_progress` if it has an unresolved upstream blocker
- Priority is a function of both urgency **and fan-out** (how many tasks does completing this one unlock?)
- Always work the **critical path** first — not the task that feels most urgent

**Prioritization heuristic:**
```
score = urgency + (blocked_tasks_count × 1.5)
```

When creating a task, explicitly ask: *"What does this block, and what blocks this?"*
Set dependency links in Mycelium before touching status.

### 3. Principle of Minimal Surprise (PMS)

Mycelium's state must remain predictable and auditable at all times.

**Rules:**
- **Prefer idempotent operations** — update before you create; never duplicate
- **Check before write** — search for an equivalent item before creating a new one
- **Always annotate mutations** — every status change, priority shift, or reassignment must carry an explicit `reason` field
- **No orphan tasks** — every task must be linked to an Epic; every Epic to a strategic goal
- Deletions are a last resort; prefer `cancelled` status with a reason

> The state of Mycelium after any operation must be explainable to another agent with zero context.
